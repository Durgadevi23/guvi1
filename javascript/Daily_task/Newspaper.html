    <h2>ELECTRIC CARS : THE FUTURE OF TRANSPORTATION</h2>
	<img src="image1.jpg" alt="Electric cars" class="img2">
	<label>with rapid advances in batteries and other technologies and increasingly supportive legislation and policies and Canada is starting to join the global shift to cleaner and electric-powered transportation.
    For over 20 years, Canadian companies and research institutions have been engaging in research and development applicable to electric vehicle (EV).<br> 
	components such as batteries, fuel cells, chargers, electric motors, power electronics, smart grids,
	monitoring software, and information services.These technologies are now being used in on-road, off-road, recreational, marine, and, just recently, aviation applications.
    Increased production levels are expected to lead to price.</label>

    <h2>A CHINESE COMPANY TO BUILD A FAKE MOON TO REPLACE THE CITY</h2>
	<label>With over 80% of Canada’s electricity produced from non-emitting sources, EVs can play a major role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from transportation, which now represents 25% of all emissions. 
    EVs are for autonomous vehicles. <br> Car-sharing strategies, which are creating a paradigm shift in how Canadians travel. This shift will lead to fewer collisions, fewer vehicles on the road, 
	and more sustainable transportation.</label>

	<h4>DOKLAM NOT FREE FOR OF PLA TROOPS</h4>
	<p>Affordability. Electric cars are less expensive to fuel and maintain than traditional combustion engine vehicles. And as new models come out, costs to buy electric cars are plummeting.</p>
    <h4>PLACE CLASHES AT INDONESHIA</h4>
	<P>Growing Infrastructure. You can plug your car in right at home. And more and more areas have charging stations for when you’re on the go.</P>
    <h4>FIVE PROTESTERS KILLED IN KDPF FIRING IN J&K </h4>
	<p>There are now more than 250 Canadian businesses involved in EV technologies creating over 30,000 jobs and this is expected to grow
